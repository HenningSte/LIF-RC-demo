        "Both Artificial Neurons and Spiking Neurons are based on biological neurons. Biological neurons can encode information through spike timing and frequencies. If and in what frequency a biological neuron fires depends on the signals the neurons gets as inputs via its dendrites from the previous cells. Some of these inputs are inhibitory and some are excitatory.\n",
        "Artificial Neurons do not adapt the temporal spect of spiking behavior. Artificial neurons all send out a scalar signal at the same time to the next layer of neurons, where the input is then combined and modified through weights to calculate the next output.\n",
        "Spiking Neurons, like the name suggests, use spike timings and spike frequencies to encode information. In this regard they are very similar to biological neurons. Most spiking neurons however only model excitatory connections and not inhibitory connections. \n",

        "In the course we already learned about some Spiking Neuron Models. The **Hodgkin Huxley Model** models the K+ and Na+ channels, which are the two ion channels that are responsible for the creation of an action potential and a leak reversal potential that models the Cl- ion reversal potential. It is biologically accurate in modeling the membrane potential during spike generation, but it requires large computational ressources and it can not be used to model larger network architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Izhikevich Model** is a two dimensional system that models the upstroke of spike generation and utilizes an auxiliary spike resetting function to model the downstroke. It is much simpler than the Hodgkin Huxley Model and can emulate all known firing patterns of cortical neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Models can be evaluated in terms of their biological plausiility and their cost of implementation. This graph shows what we touched on above: The Hodgkin-Huxley-Model has a high implementation cost but also models the biological behavior very well. The Izhikevich Model is nearly as biological plausible as the Hodgkin-Huxley Model but is much more efficient. The integrate-and-fire variations are mostly even more efficient than the Inzhikevich Model but they are not as biologically plausible.\n",

        "### 1.3 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model\n",
        "For Integrate-and-Fire Models we assume that sub-threshold dynamics of a neuron are a kind of summation process so that inputs to a neuron are summed over time. When a certain threshold is reached, i.e. when there were enough inputs into the neuron, than the neuron spikes and creates an action potential. The moment when the threshold is crossed is called the firing time. The simplest form of Integrate-and-Fire Models is a **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model**. To account for a decline in potential over time if the threshold is not reached after an input current, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model adds a leak current which models the drift of ions through the membrane back to the equilibrium. We can derive the model by thinking of the passive membrane as a battery of potential $u_{rest}$ with a capacitator $C$ in parallel with a resistor $R$.\n",

        "![alt text](img/MembraneAsBattery.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The potential of the battery $u_t$ depends on the driving current $I(t)$. The resistor is a passive circuit component with electrical resistance that restricts the flow of the current. The Capacitor is also a passive component that can store electrical charge. The one used for this model is a non-polarized capacitor which means that it does not matter which side is connected to the positive and which side is connected to the negative pole.\n",
        "If there is no driving current $I(t)$, the voltage at the capacitor is $u_{rest}$, the battery voltage. We can analyse the driving current $I(t)$ by splitting it into two components:\n",

We can use this to calculate $I_R = u_R/ R$ with $u_R = u - u_{rest}$ as the voltage across the resistor.\n",
        "\n",
        "$I_C:$ current that charges the capacitor $C$ when the potential of the electrode changes. The capacitance $C$ of a capacitor is the ratio of charge $q$ and voltage $u$ so that $C = q/u$. The current flow through a capacitor is the product of the capacitance $C$ and the rate of change of the voltage $du/dt$, so that $I_C = Cdu/dt$.\n",

The function below includes code for three different types of streams: A continuous stream, a spiking stream with small bursts in regular intervals and sinusodial input waves that change input strength with a set frequency. The length of the input stream is given in time steps. The form of the input streams can be modulated by some different parameters: the parameter $strength$ indicates the highest possible voltage that is put into the neuron. The parameter $frequency$ determines, how fast the current repeats. The value of the frequency indicates how much of the current cycle fits into a single time step. A frequency of 0.1 therefore indicates a spike every ten time steps for the spiking current or for the sinusoidal current that the curve repeats every ten time steps. The sequence length can be calculaated with 1/$frequency$. Their is a number of time steps at the beginning and end of every input current stream that is zero so that we can examine the behavior of the neuron when the current starts up or stops.\n",
